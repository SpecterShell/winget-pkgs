ShortDescription: 3D geologic and scientific modeling software.
Description: |-
  Voxler, a three-dimensional scientific visualization program oriented primarily toward volumetric rendering and three-dimensional data display. While the emphasis is on three-dimensional volumes, Voxler can also utilize two-dimensional grids including DEM files, images, and scattered point data. Voxler can display streamlines, vector plots, contour maps, isosurfaces, image slices, three-dimensional scatter plots, direct volume rendering, 3D blocks, well traces, and more. Computational modules include three-dimensional gridding, resampling, numerous lattice operations, and image processing. Voxler is designed for displaying XYZC data, where C is a variable at each X, Y, and Z location.
  With Voxler, you can create stunning graphics output for your true three-dimensional models. Models can be sliced, displayed at any angle, and even animated with a simple mouse movement. Standard or custom colorization can be applied to the models.
